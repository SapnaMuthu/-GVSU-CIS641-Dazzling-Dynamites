<h2 span style="color:#1F83FF;font-weight:500;font-style:italic"> Project Overview: 
</h2>

Our Project idea is to develop a Food Recipe App that shows the user about the instructions on how to prepare a specific 
food item along with the extra information like the ingredients, nutrients, servings, and preparation time. The user can 
search with a particular keyword like "Pizza" and it would display all the available food recipes for Pizza. Afterwards,
the user can add a specific food recipe to the wish list if they like the recipe and scroll through the wish-listed food
recipes later.
