# Introduction

Our Project idea is to develop a Food Recipe App that shows the user about the instructions on how to prepare a specific food item along with the extra information like the ingredients, nutrients, servings, and preparation time. The user can search with a particular keyword like "Pizza" and it would display all the available food recipes for Pizza. After which, the user can add a specific food recipe to the wishlist if they like the recipe and can scroll through the wishlisted food recipes later.  

# Anticipated Technologies

* Expo and React Native is used to Build the Application. 
* Firebase User Authenticate to Authenticate the existing user and to create a new user. 
* Firebase Database for the Mobile Backend. 
* Firebase Analytics to perform the reporting.
* RecipesAPI is used extract the recipe details along with the ingredients, nutrients, and servings for a particular food item. 

# Method/Approach

- Equally distribute the functional requirements of the Food Recipe app across the team member.
- Create a well designed foreground user interface that appeals to a large user base.
- Proper Integration with the Firebase to authenticate the User and to create a new User.
- Maintaing the list of user's Wishlisted food recipes in the firebase database.
- Ensuring the stability of the App without crashing.
- Integration with the existing web API, RecipesAPI.


# Estimated Timeline

Major milestones for this project are as follows:

- App must have a fully functional and well designed user interface.
- App must persist data between user sessions via local storage on the device or via web services.
- The data should be passed between the screens. 
- App should be stable and not crashed.
- Mobile Backend Integrity with the Firebase Database. 
- Reliablity of the RecipesAPI when extracting the food recipe details.

Each one of us would work on the different screens and would finally integrate them to make it fully functional. We anticipate to complete the project in a month with uniterrupted efforts and if there are no issues in between. 

# Anticipated Problems

* Invalid API Key error when using the RecipesAPI.
* Firebase Integration Errors which may cause trouble in authenticating the user or adding a new user.
* Extracting the details of the user's wishlisted food recipes from the Firebase.
